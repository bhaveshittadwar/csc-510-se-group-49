#  Reflecting on the Challenges and Lessons Learned(750 words+)

Project 1 has been a great learning experience and a test of our problem solving abilities. We have encountered several problems and have gained valuable lessons throughout the project. In this report, we will examine the issues we faced and how they could have been avoided. We are committed to implement best practices for Project-2.

## What was hard about this process?

### 1. Environment Setup

-   The documentation did not provide guidance for setting up the development environment across different devices. The project's dependencies and tools might need separate configurations for different Operating systems, versions, or types (for example, Mac Intel, Mac M1(/2) chips). To run on a Mac M1 we configured dos2unix.

### 2. Hardcoded & expired API tokens

-  The bash script present in the code had a hardcoded API Token (ref:  [https://github.com/prithvish-doshi-17/MyDollarBot-BOTGo/blob/main/user.properties](https://github.com/prithvish-doshi-17/MyDollarBot-BOTGo/blob/main/user.properties)) This caused errors with the project's functionality. As a result, the test cases were failing.

### 3. Test-Case mismatch

-  One of the test cases was specified but the mock data for it was missing leading to failed test cases. (Ref:  [https://github.com/prithvish-doshi-17/MyDollarBot-BOTGo/blob/main/test/test_helper.py#L176](https://github.com/prithvish-doshi-17/MyDollarBot-BOTGo/blob/main/test/test_helper.py#L176))

### 4. Bot claimed to be deployed, but couldn't find

-   The docs mention how the bot is deployed using GCP (reference:  [https://github.com/prithvish-doshi-17/MyDollarBot-BOTGo#whats-new-from-phase-2-to-phase-3](https://github.com/prithvish-doshi-17/MyDollarBot-BOTGo#whats-new-from-phase-2-to-phase-3)) but wasn't found on telegram. 

### 5. A few commands mentioned were not running

-   The command  `python run -m pytest test/`  was either a deprecated command or an incorrect one. This discrepancy created confusion and affected the project's progress.

## How that pain could have been avoided

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation

-   Ensure that the project's documentation includes detailed instructions for setting up the development environment on various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and architecture types (e.g., Mac M1). This documentation should provide step-by-step guidance, including any platform-specific considerations. It should also provide a overview of configuring dependencies for different operating systems and hardware architecture.

### 2. Versions

-   There were no specific versions for any dependencies in the requirements.txt file which lead to compatibility issues and uncertainty over the versions of all dependencies used in the project. Just mentioning the versions would help save a lot of setup time and would eliminate guesswork about which version would run that project.

### 3. Overview of test cases

-   A comprehensive overview of test cases in the docs would have helped us navigate through the errors and test failures with more certainty. It would have facilitated troubleshooting and debugging.

### 4. Description of how GCP is set up for the bot

-   As mentioned earlier we were not able to find the deployed bot on Telegram and a detailed guide on how the Google Cloud Platform environment was set up could have helped us demystify why the deployed service was no longer active.

### 5. Storing Token Handling

Sensitive information such as API Tokens, keys, and passwords should never be pushed into the code. Making use of  `.env`  file and documenting how to create a user and generate an API token would've been clearer and more secure.

## The practices we are committing to perform in the project 2

We recognize the importance of adopting best practices to ensure a more smooth execution of Project-2. Also, we could consider containerization to avoid device-specific setup complications using Docker. This provides easier reproducible setups.

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation

There were a lot of places where just having clearer documentation could have saved us a lot of time and effort. For instance: OS-specific steps for setting up would have quickly helped us set up the project on different Mac and Windows OS. Also, a better description of what each unit test checks would have helped us understand better the intent of writing that test case. For GCP, if we could find a doc explaining how it was set up, we could figure out easily why it's no longer available on the specified channel. We will improve and articulate any and every detail that we can include in the documentation.

### 2. Version Control

-   The requirements.txt file doesn't mention the version for any of the dependencies. Packages are always evolving and may not be forward-compatible. Just mentioning the versions used while creating the project eliminates any kind of uncertainty. We will ascertain all the versions for the project. This will eliminate uncertainties and compatibility problems.

### 3. Setting up environment variables

- We'll all the hardcoded sensitive information such as API tokens or keys etc and write a doc on how to set them up locally with an example.

### 4. Dockerization

- To truly make this project platform independent and free from setup effort and guesswork we aim to containerize this application so that it can be setup anywhere quickly.

### 5. Test Case Clarity

- We recognize the importance of well-defined test cases. We will make sure that in Project-2 the test cases are thoroughly documented and also include detailed explanations of what each test case verifies and what is the expected output.
